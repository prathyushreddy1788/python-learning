#Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the longest
# consecutive subsequence (sorted in ascending order) from the input list.
# A consecutive subsequence is a sequence of numbers where each number appears exactly once and
# the numbers are in consecutive order. For example, if the input list is ,
# the function should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
