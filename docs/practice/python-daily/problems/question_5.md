Given two dictionaries representing the inventory of two stores, where keys are item names and values are quantities in stock, write a Python function to merge these dictionaries. If an item is present in both dictionaries, sum the quantities. The function should return the merged dictionary. 
 
For example:

store1 = {"apple": 10, "banana": 5, "orange": 8}
store2 = {"banana": 3, "orange": 6, "grapes": 12}

After merging, the dictionary should be 

{"apple": 10, "banana": 8, "orange": 14, "grapes": 12}.
