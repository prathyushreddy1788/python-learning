Write a Python function that takes a string as input and checks whether it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). The function should return True if the input is a palindrome and False otherwise. For example, if the input is "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", the function should return True.
