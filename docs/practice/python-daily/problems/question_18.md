*Online Shopping Cart**

Design an OnlineShoppingCart class that represents a shopping cart for an online store. The class should have methods to add items, remove items, calculate the total price, and apply discounts. Each item can have attributes like name, price, and quantity. Implement methods to display the cart contents and the final invoice after applying discounts.
