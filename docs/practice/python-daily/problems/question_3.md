You are given a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains information about a person (name, age, and country). Write a Python function that takes this list as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are countries and the values are lists of names of people from that country. For example, if the input list is [ {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "country": "USA"}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 25, "country": "Canada"}, {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35, "country": "USA"}, {"name": "David", "age": 40, "country": "Canada"}], the function should return {"USA": ["Alice", "Charlie"], "Canada": ["Bob", "David"]}.
