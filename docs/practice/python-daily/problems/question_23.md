Palindrome Pairs
Write a Python program (class approach) that takes a list of words as input and returns all pairs of words that, when combined, form a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that reads the same forward and backward. Assume that the list of words does not contain duplicates.

Example:
Input: ["bat", "tab", "cat", "tac"]
Output: [("bat", "tab"), ("cat", "tac")]
