Write a Python function that takes a string as input and counts the number of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters (symbols and spaces) in the string. The function should return these counts as a dictionary. For example, if the input is "Hello World, 123!", the function should return {"uppercase": 2, "lowercase": 8, "digits": 3, "special_characters": 3}.
