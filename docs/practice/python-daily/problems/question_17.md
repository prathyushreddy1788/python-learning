**Bank Account Management**

Create a BankAccount class that represents a bank account. The class should have methods to deposit money, withdraw money, check balance, and display transaction history. Ensure that the account cannot be overdrawn (i.e., the balance cannot go below zero). Implement a mechanism to keep track of the transaction history (e.g., date, transaction type, amount).
