#using sort method arrage the list of numbers in the list in ascending order
# we have to divide the list into number of sublists
# if the difference between two consecutive numbers in the list is greater than 1, then we have to create a list at this point
# then we have to compare the length of the sublists that are generated.
# the longest sublist is the list containing longest consecutive subsequence
