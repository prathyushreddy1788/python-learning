# we have remove all the special characters,spaces and convert the string into lower case
# we have to check if each element in the input strings is present among the list of alphabets.....
# if that element is not present in the list of alphabets we have to ignore it and print
# rest of the elements
#we have to converst both the strings into lower cases
#now we have two strings with no spaces,special characters,punctuations and all of them are in lower cases
#now we have to compare both the strings
#know the length of the string = n
# we have to iterate over the length of the string(for i in range(0:n)
#if 1st alphabet in string-1[n-i+1] is equal to last alphabet in string-2[n-1] continue to next iteration

# if
#else: print "not a palindrome number"
