# Programming Questions

## Question 1:
Write a Python program that does the following:
- Creates an empty list.
- Asks the user to enter five numbers, one at a time, and appends each number to the list.
- Calculates and prints the sum of the numbers in the list.

## Question 2:
Create a Python dictionary representing a book with the following information:
- Title: "Python Programming"
- Author: "John Smith"
- ISBN: "978-1234567890"
- Year: 2022
Write a function that takes the dictionary as input and prints each key-value pair in a readable format.

## Question 3:
Write a Python program that uses a `for` loop to print the first 10 even numbers (starting from 2) on separate lines.

## Question 4:
Write a Python function that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward. For example, "racecar" and "madam" are palindromes.

## Question 5:
Create a Python module named "math_operations" that includes the following functions:
- `add(a, b)`: Adds two numbers and returns the result.
- `subtract(a, b)`: Subtracts the second number from the first and returns the result.
- `multiply(a, b)`: Multiplies two numbers and returns the result.
- `divide(a, b)`: Divides the first number by the second (non-zero) number and returns the result.
Write a separate Python script that imports the "math_operations" module and uses its functions to perform basic mathematical operations.
