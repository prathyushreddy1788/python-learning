# Python Assignment - Moderate Questions

---

### 1. Function Basics
Write a Python function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. Then, call this function and print the result.

### 2. Exception Handling
Create a program that asks the user for input and handles a ValueError if the input cannot be converted to an integer. Provide an appropriate error message.

### 3. File Reading
Write a Python program that reads a text file ("sample.txt") line by line and prints each line.

### 4. List Comprehensions
Given a list of numbers, use a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the even numbers.

### 5. Debugging
Debug and correct it, explaining the errors you find.

def calculate_sum(a, b):
result = a + b
    return result

x = 5
y = 7
print(calculate_sum(x, y))


### 6. Module Import
Create a Python module with a function that calculates the factorial of a number. Import this module into your main program and use the function to find the factorial of a given number.

### 7. File Writing
Write a Python program that asks the user to enter their name and then saves it to a file called "names.txt."

### 8. Error Handling with File I/O
Modify the file reading program from question 3 to handle the case where the file doesn't exist, displaying an error message.

### 9. Function with Default Arguments
Create a function that takes two arguments, one required and one optional. The optional argument should have a default value. Demonstrate calling this function both with and without providing the optional argument.
